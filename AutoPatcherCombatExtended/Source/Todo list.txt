TODO ThingDef tags
TODO add logic to GetOriginalData to allow re-patching of already compatible defs
TODO remove settings to enable/disable patching of certain defTypes, is just bloat at this point
TODO make stringify/destringify virtual methods in base DefDataHolder, with overrides in the various subclasses
